# 💫About Me :
For the last 4 years, I have had the opportunity to work with all major libraries in Python. I have worked with API development, scraped various websites, developed many bots and manipulate data. I support on many startups, personal projects. I enjoy my work and desire to support people with my coding skill.\
I'm pretty boring.
